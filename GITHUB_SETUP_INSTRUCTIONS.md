# GitHub Setup Instructions for Niuma Project

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com and sign in to your account
2. Click the '+' icon in the top right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Enter 'Niuma' as the repository name
4. Add a description like 'React-based salary calculator application'
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these)
7. Click 'Create repository'

## Step 2: Add Remote Origin and Push

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Niuma.git

# Ensure we're on the main branch
git branch -M main

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.
