# GitHub Setup Instructions for Niuma Project

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com and sign in to your account
2. Click the '+' icon in the top right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Enter 'Niuma' as the repository name
4. Add a description like 'React-based salary calculator application'
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these)
7. Click 'Create repository'

## Step 2: Setup SSH Key (Recommended)

To avoid connection timeout issues, it's recommended to use SSH instead of HTTPS:

1. **Generate SSH key** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Add SSH key to ssh-agent**:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

3. **Copy your public key**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

4. **Add the key to GitHub**:
   - Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your public key and save

## Step 3: Add Remote Origin and Push

After creating the repository and setting up SSH, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin (using SSH)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/Niuma.git

# Ensure we're on the main branch
git branch -M main

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Alternative: Using HTTPS (if SSH is not available)
If you prefer HTTPS or SSH is not available:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Niuma.git
```
Note: HTTPS may experience connection timeouts on port 443.
